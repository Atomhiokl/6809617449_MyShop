                        <p>He is a normal man, ordinary in everything he tries. He works so hard to keep up with his friends, but he couldn’t reach them. Yet, he never gives up, even when it’s hard or seems like nothing matters at all. I believe that one day, he will be able to save “it.”</p>

                <p>He was once a god. Born rich, he had everything and saw everything. But he was different from any other wealthy being in the galaxy. He tried to help everyone, yet he said that to create the future, sacrifices must be made.</p>
                <p>Then someone said it was not right to just leave things behind — we must face them and deal with them. He once felt Bad, but he couldn’t risk “it.” He fought, and in the final moment of his life, he believed he could save “it.”</p>
